        I received my B.S. in Mathematics at Gannon University in 2017. After this, I attended graduate school at the University of Notre Dame, where I received my M.S. in Mathematics in 2019, and my Ph.D. in 2023. I then have been at the University of Notre Dame as a Visiting Assistant Professor until the present.

    One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
    over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the
    grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names
    were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and
    were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all
    scientific knowledge and new discovery. Before that night—a memorable night,
    as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the rising
    smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing any special inspiration from
    the fact.
