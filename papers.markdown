We prove a case of a positivity conjecture of Mihalcea-Singh, concerned with the local Euler obstructions associated to the Schubert stratification of the Lagrangian Grassmannian <la-tex>LG(n,2n)</la-tex>. Combined with work of Aluffi-Mihalcea-Sch√ºrmann-Su, this further implies the positivity of the Mather classes for Schubert varieties in <la-tex>LG(n,2n)</la-tex>, which Mihalcea-Singh had verified for the other cominuscule spaces of classical Lie type. Building on the work of Boe and Fu, we give a positive recursion for the local Euler obstructions, and use it to show that they provide a positive count of admissible labelings of certain trees, analogous to the ones describing Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. Unlike in the case of the Grassmannians in types A and D, for <la-tex>LG(n,2n)</la-tex> the Euler obstructions <la-tex>e_{y,w}</la-tex> may vanish for certain pairs <la-tex>(y,w)</la-tex> with <la-tex>y \leq w</la-tex> in the Bruhat order. Our combinatorial description allows us to classify all the pairs <la-tex>(y,w)</la-tex> for which <la-tex>e_{y,w}=0</la-tex>. Restricting to the big opposite cell in <la-tex>LG(n,2n)</la-tex>, which is naturally identified with the space of <la-tex>n \times n</la-tex> symmetric matrices, we recover the formulas for the local Euler obstructions associated with the matrix rank stratification.

* **Improved Bounds on the Anti-Waring Number**, joint with David Prier - **2017**<br>(<a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL20/Prier/prier3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Journal of Integer Sequences</a>)

The Anti-Waring number, <la-tex>N(k,r)</la-tex>, is defined to be the least integer such that it and every larger integer can be written as the sum of the <la-tex>k</la-tex>th powers of <la-tex>r</la-tex> or more distinct positive integers. Several authors have examined this variation of the classical Waring problem. We provide improved bounds for <la-tex>N(k,r)</la-tex> in general and when <la-tex>k = 2</la-tex>. We then connect this problem to the theory of partitions. We use traditional counting arguments, as well as a generating function methodology that has not yet been applied to finding the Anti-Waring number.
